"""
The package is a compilation of python and fortran scripts required to run elementary and standardized tests required to test cohesive zone models using abaqus cae.
Modules in the package have the functions necessary to preprocess and postprocess the tests.
This is achieved using some abaqus python scripts and some python stand alone scripts however both can not be executed together. 
Examples to implement the codes are provided in :ref:`Test Cases` section of the documentation.
Following is the documentation for the scripts.
