# Project Description

This repository has python package ``czmtestkit`` developed for generating abaqus cae models required to test abaqus user subroutines for implementing cohesive zone models as well as post processing the results.

## Software v1.0.0-a.1.0.0

**Current Status:**  
* Funcitons to generate input files for single element and non standard tests with and without substrates.
* Sample test cases for single element test.
* Module functions for generating parts required for standardized tests are available.
* History output can be extracted from abaqus output data base.
* Magnitudes of load and displacement extracted from the history output can be plotted.  
 
**Future developments:**  
*  Functions to generate assemblies and input files for mixed mode characterization using standardized tests (DCB, ADCB, ASLB, SLB, ENF)
*  Example standarized test cases.
*  Extend package to include fortran based user element subroutines for the cohesive zone. 
*  Class to define part properties

## Documentation v1.0.0-a.1.0.0

**Current Status:**  
* Module and function documentation.
* Base theme and template.
 
**Future developments:**  
*  Pictorial representation of output bodies from part definitions and assembly definitions.
*  Documentation and code citation information.
*  Interactive options for authors.
